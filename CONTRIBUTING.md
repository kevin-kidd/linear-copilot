* Use proper error handling with typed errors

### Testing

* Write tests for all new features
* Maintain existing tests
* Run the entire test suite before submitting a pull request
* Follow the existing test patterns
* Include both unit and integration tests where appropriate
* Mock external services appropriately
* Test error conditions and edge cases
* Aim for high test coverage on new code
